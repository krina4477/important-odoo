Version : 16.0.0.1
Bug :
    - Fixed the issue; When the opportunity which is in "crm.lrad" is in the won stage then move into the new stage at that; in "hr.employee" won opportunity count and the amount is not changed by single refresh.

Improvement :
    - In the >>Crm > Reporting > "Won Opportunity Progress"(new submenu) it shows only tree view of that data so add the tree view,too.
